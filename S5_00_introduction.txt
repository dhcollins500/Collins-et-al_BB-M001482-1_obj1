Supplementary File S5 Introduction

Supplementary file S5 contains the scripts necesary to:
1) reproduce the analysis of Apis mellifera mRNA-seq data from Cameron et al. (2013) and 
He et al. (2017) with the HISAT2/HTSeq pipeline.
2) compare the results of 1) with the HISAT2/HTSeq analysis of curent study data from supplementary
file S4.
3) reproduce the analysis of Bombus terrestris mRNA-Seq data from Amsalem et al. (2015) and
identify diapause specific genes.
4) repeat the analysis of 2) with the genes identified in 3) removed. 
5) compare the results of 3) with the current study HISAT2/HTSeq analysis from supplementary
file S4.

The five analyses above are referred to by their number in the "subsections" line in the headers of 
the scripts, in order to show which analysis/analyses the script belongs to.

Overview of the numbered scripts:

General note: Script S5_50 requires the user to change a file path to make it
			  specific to their own computer. This instance is highlighted with CHANGE
			  in the comments.

Scripts S5_01 to S5_07 perform necesary preliminary tasks such as downloading genome
related files and indexing them.
S5_01: Initiates directory structure for the rest of the analysis, moves the scripts
	   and lists of Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accessions into the correct directories.
S5_02: Downloads the mRNA-seq data for Cameron et al. (2013) from the SRA.
S5_03: Downloads the mRNA-seq data for He et al. (2017) from the SRA.
S5_04: Downloads the mRNA-seq data for Amsalem et al. (2015) from the SRA.
S5_05: Downloads genome sequence, GTF file, and associated checksums from Ensembl for Apis mellifera
	and Bombus terrestris.
S5_06: Verifies that the files downloaded from Ensembl are complete using checksums.
S5_07: Indexes the Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris genomes for HISAT2, and the GTF files for ALFA.

Script S5_10 conducts FastQC analysis on the mRNA-seq reads for all studies downloaded from SRA,
	and generates individual MultiQC reports for each study.

Scripts S5_20 and S5_22 aligns the mRNA-Seq reads to the relevant genome using HISAT2.
S5_20: Aligns mRNA-seq reads from Cameron et al. (2013) to the Apis mellifera genome using HISAT2,
	and generates a MultiQC report of the alignment summeries.
S5_21: Aligns mRNA-seq reads from He et al. (2017) to the Apis mellifera genome using HISAT2,
	and generates a MultiQC report of the alignment summeries.
S5_22: Aligns mRNA-seq reads from Amsalem et al. (2015) to the Bombus terrestris genome using HISAT2,
	and generates a MultiQC report of the alignment summeries.

Script S5_30 conducts ALFA analysis on the HISAT2 alignments from scripts S5_20, S5_21 and S5_22.

Scripts S5_40 to S5_42 counts the reads aligned per gene with HTSeq-count.
S5_40: Counts the reads per gene with HTSeq-count for the alignments of Cameron et al. (2013)
	   mRNA-seq reads to the Apis mellifera genome.
S5_41: Counts the reads per gene with HTSeq-count for the alignments of He et al. (2017) 
	   mRNA-seq reads to the Apis mellifera genome.
S5_42: Counts the reads per gene with HTSeq-count for the alignments of Amsalem et al. (2015) 
	   mRNA-seq reads to the Bombus terrestris genome.

Scripts S5_50 to S5_54 import the HTSeq-count reads into R, generate DESeq2 objects,
generate diagnostic plots for the differential expression analysis, generate lists
of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for Cameron et al. (2013), He et al. (2017)
and Amsalem et al. (2015), and determine diapause-specific genes.
S5_50: Imports HTSeq results into R and then generates a DESeq2 object for each study.
S5_51: Generates principal component analysis (PCA) and normalization boxplot for each study.
S5_52: Generates lists of DEGs for the Apis mellifera studies (Cameron et al. (2013) and He 
et al. (2017).
S5_53: Generates lists of DEGs for Amsalem et al. (2015).
S5_54: Determines which DEGs from Amsalem et al. (2015) are specifically differentially
expressed during diapause in Bombus terrestris queens.

Scripts S5_60 and S5_61 prepare the gene lists for the comparative analysis and then conducts
the comparitive analysis between Bombus terrestris (current study) and Apis mellifera (Cameron
et al. (2013) and He et al. (2017)) with Bombus terrestris diapause genes (Amsalem et al. (2015))
included and excluded.
S5_60: Prepares for the comparative analysis by copying all necessary gene lists into a new
directory.
S5_61: Conducts comparative analysis.

Script S5_70 compares the lists of DEGs from the current study to diapause genes from Amsalem et al.
(2015) and uses Fisher's Exact tests to determine significant overlap.
