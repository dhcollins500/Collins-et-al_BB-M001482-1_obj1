Collins, D. H., Wirén, A., Labédan, M., Smith, M., Prince, D.C., Mohorianu, I., Dalmay, T., & Bourke, A. F. G. (2020). Gene expression in larval caste determination of bumblebees and the transition to advanced eusociality.

This GitHub project contains R script and accompanying data files for reproduction of the analysis produced for the above study. Files labelled S2 contains R scripts for the reciprocal best-hit blast (RBH) search between Bombus terrestris and Drosophila melanogaster and the RBH search between B. terrestris and A. mellifera. Files labelled S3 contains R scripts to recreate most of the figures (e.g the stacked bar plot, the heatmap, the combine qrtpcr and mrnaseq summary figure, the GO analysis plot, the euler plot) and the qRT-PCR analysis (the reference gene selection scripts, and the qRT-PCR analysis), one S3 script uses the output of the S2 script to produce a GO analysis of the D. melanogaster orthologs in B. terrestris, one S3 script compares lists of differentially expressed genes in A. mellifera (produced from two A. mellifera studies, see main maunscript) with the differentially expressed genes in B. terrestris produced in this study. Files labelled S4 are to analyse the data using standard pipelines (Kallisto and HISAT2/HTSeq pipelines) and then compare their outputs with the pipeline used in the current study (PatMan/confidence-interval pipeline).


Further explanation of the methods used to generate these data are available in the accompanying mansuscript and detailed descriptions of the scripts are available in each script and a detailed description of the S4 scripts is available in
