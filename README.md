Collins, D. H., Wirén, A., Labédan, M., Smith, M., Prince, D.C., Mohorianu, I., Dalmay, T., & Bourke, A. F. G. (2020). Gene expression in larval caste determination of bumblebees and the transition to advanced eusociality.

This GitHub project contains R script and accompanying data files for reproduction of the analysis produced for the above study. Supplementary File 2 contains R scripts for the reciprocal best-hit blast (RBH) search between Bombus terrestris and Drosophila melanogaster and the RBH search between B. terrestris and A. mellifera. Supplementary File 3 contains R scripts to recreate most of the figures, and the qRT-PCR analysis. It also uses the outputs of the RBH analyses in Supplementary File 2 to produce a GO analysis of the D. melanogaster orthologs in B. terrestris, and to compare lists of differentially expressed genes in A. mellifera (produced from two A. mellifera studies, see main maunscript) with the differentially expressed genes in B. terrestris produced in this study.  Further explanation of the methods used to generate these data are available in the accompanying mansuscript and detailed descriptions of the scripts are available in Supplementary File S2 and Supplementary File S3.
